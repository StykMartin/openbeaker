# OpenBeaker

This is a fork of [Beaker](https://github.com/beaker-project/beaker).

## What is the difference between Beaker and OpenBeaker
- All code will be open source. No hidden bits about operations. CI/CD will be available for everyone and you can replicate it.
- OpenBeaker is/will be unstable on API level for some time. One of the efforts is to port whole OpenBeaker to Python 3.
- Fast moving :rocket:. Fail fast fail often.
