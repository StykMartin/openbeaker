What's New in Beaker 0.11?
==========================

Backwards-incompatible changes
------------------------------

In previous versions of Beaker, shell metacharacters in custom repo URLs were 
not escaped when writing to ``/etc/yum.repos.d``. In particular, if your custom 
repo URL contained a yum variable, it had to be escaped as ``\$`` to prevent 
bash from interpreting it. This escaping is no longer necessary. See bug 
:issue:`880039` for full details.

New reporting and metrics features
----------------------------------

Beaker now includes a number of "supported" reporting queries, which can be 
used for in-depth historical analysis of your Beaker installation. See 
:ref:`reporting-queries` for full details. (Contributed by Dan Callaghan and 
Raymond Mancy in :issue:`193142`, :issue:`591656`, :issue:`741960`, 
:issue:`877264`, :issue:`877272`, :issue:`877274`.)

Beaker's integration with the Graphite real-time metrics tool, originally added 
in version 0.9.4, has also been expanded. See :ref:`graphite` for details about 
the metrics Beaker sends to Graphite. (Contributed by Dan Callaghan and Nick 
Coghlan in :issue:`584783`, :issue:`695986`, :issue:`839583`).

If you are using an external reporting tool with your Beaker installation, you 
can add links to the reports on the new External Reports page. (Contributed by 
Raymond Mancy in :issue:`883606`.)

Documentation improvements
--------------------------

- Beaker's documentation is now in reStructuredText format and is built using 
  `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_. It was also re-arranged to improve 
  clarity.
- The :doc:`Creating a task <../user-guide/example-task>` section has been improved and updated to describe 
  using :program:`beaker-wizard`. (Contributed by Amit Saha in
  :issue:`872428`.)
- New sections were added to the Administration Guide describing :ref:`Graphite
  integration <graphite>` and :ref:`reporting queries <reporting-queries>`. 
  (Contributed by Dan Callaghan and Nick Coghlan.)
- The Installation Guide was removed in favour of targeted instructions in the 
  User and Administration Guides. (Contributed by Dan Callaghan.)

Other enhancements
------------------

- Default install options can be applied to an entire distro family. 
  (Contributed by Dan Callaghan in :issue:`873714`.)
- New kickstart snippet, ``timezone``, allowing administrators to customize the 
  default timezone per lab. (Contributed by Bill Peck in :issue:`876582`.)
- Users can change their own Beaker account password, if their account is using 
  password authentication. (Contributed by Raymond Mancy in :issue:`865676`.)
- The :ref:`bkr machine-test <bkr-machine-test>` command will avoid scheduling 
  recipes with distro families which are excluded for that system. (Contributed 
  by Bill Peck in :issue:`876752`.)
- New kickstart metadata variable, ``fstype``, to control filesystem type used 
  during installation. The distro default is used if no explicit filesystem 
  type is requested. (Contributed by Jun'ichi NOMURA in :issue:`865679`.)
- New kickstart metadata variable, ``linkdelay``, to add ``LINKDELAY`` to 
  network interface configuration files. (Contributed by Jun'ichi NOMURA in 
  :issue:`865680`.)
- Lab controller daemons use python-daemon for daemonizing. (Contributed by 
  James de Vries in :issue:`813574`.)
- Transaction handling and exception handling in beakerd is cleaner and 
  simpler. (Contributed by Dan Callaghan in :issue:`880853`.)
